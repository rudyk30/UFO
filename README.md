# UFO Sightings Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time such as city, state, country, and shape.

## Results 

The power of this new webpage is that is contains the ability for a user to dynamically filter the data according to their desired parameters. Lets walk through an example. 

First, navigate to the "Filter Search section"

Here you can choose to enter in a city, state, country and shape. You may choose to filter by one or all of the parameters. In this example, we will search of triangular shaped UFO's.

If you wish to start over, click the "clear table" button

And that is how you filter!


## Summary

One drawback of this design is there could be more data on UFO's in the site that includes news articles from sightings, images and videos. This way the table becomes even more interactive for users and they can learn more about the sightings. 

Two ways this can be done is:

* Use an API from Youtube to get videos from famous sightings 
* Read in a JSON file from New York Times or another news source that contains articles written about UFO sightings that users can read.
